This repository contains lecture notes and exercises for the course Development of Large Systems at Copenhagen Business Academy.


The lecture notes will be dropped in this repository. Likely it is best for you to fork this repository, see https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2018fall-lsd-teaching-material/tree/master/lecture_notes#fork-destination-box, so that you can enrich it with your own notes aside.
